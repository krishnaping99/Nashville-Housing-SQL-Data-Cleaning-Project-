# Nashville-Housing-SQL-Data-Cleaning-Project-

## Overview

Welcome to the Nashville Housing Data Cleaning project repository. In this project, we perform data cleaning and preparation on the Nashville Housing Dataset using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and SQL querying Language. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understand the project's objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.

## Dataset Description

The Nashville Housing Dataset is a comprehensive collection of housing data in Nashville, Tennessee. It contains a wide range of information related to properties, including property details, pricing, addresses, and various attributes that impact the real estate market.

## Project Objectives

* **Data Transformation:** Performing data transformation tasks, including standardizing data formats, converting data types, and creating new features or columns that may be useful for analysis.
* **Handling Missing Values:** Comprehensive strategies are applied to manage missing data and NULL values, ensuring minimal impact on the analysis.
* **Deduplication:** Removal of duplicate records to maintain data accuracy.
* **Data Validation:** The data is validated against defined constraints and rules to ensure data quality.
* **Data Quality Assessment:** A thorough assessment of data quality is conducted, addressing integrity and consistency issues.

## Tools Used

* **SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)** was used as the database management system for storing and manipulating the Nashville Housing Dataset.
* **SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the primary language for data cleaning and transformation tasks.
